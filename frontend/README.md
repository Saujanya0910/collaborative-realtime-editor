# Real-time Code Editor Web App
A real-time code editor web app that allows users to share and edit code in real-time. Also lets users compile and execute their code in real-time.
The app is built using React.js built using Vite for the frontend, and Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io for the backend. All the data is stored in-memory and is not persisted as of v2.
